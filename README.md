### Consensus Mechanism

QRaft, a hybrid distributed network, treats each user as a node, the bot as the client, and the database as the centralized entity. This approach ensures secure and efficient transaction processing.

### ACID Principles

To isolate transactions and maintain consistency, QRaft adheres to ACID principles. This prevents multiple users from getting the same stock price simultaneously, enhancing realism in the stock market game.
